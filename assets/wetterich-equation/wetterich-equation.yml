  The Wetterich eqn. is a non-linear functional integro-differential equation of one-loop structure that determines the scale-dependence of the flowing action $\Gamma_k$ in terms of fluctuations of the fully-dressed regularized propagator $[\Gamma_k^{(2)} + R_k]^{-1}$. It admits a simple diagrammatic representation as a one-loop equation as shown in this diagram.
