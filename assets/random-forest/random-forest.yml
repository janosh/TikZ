  Diagram of the random forest (RF) algorithm (Breiman 2001). RFs are ensembles model consisting of binary decision trees that predicts the mode of individual tree predictions in classification or the mean in regression. Every node in a decision tree is a condition on a single feature, chosen to split the dataset into two so that similar samples end up in the same set. RFs are inspectable, invariant to scaling and other feature transformations, robust to inclusion of irrelevant features and can estimate feature importance via mean decrease in impurity (MDI).
