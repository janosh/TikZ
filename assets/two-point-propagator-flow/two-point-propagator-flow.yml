  Feynman diagrams showing the flow equation for the two-point correlation function
  in the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. These diagrams represent
  the right-hand side of the Wetterich equation for the two-point function,
  consisting of one-loop diagrams with a regulator insertion (cross) and dressed
  vertices (hatched circles). The diagrams capture quantum fluctuations at
  different momentum scales, important for understanding how correlation functions
  evolve as the energy scale changes in quantum field theories.
