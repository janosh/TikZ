title: GNN Node Aggregation
description: >
  Diagram illustrating the message-passing process in graph neural networks (GNNs).
  Shows how information flows from neighboring nodes to a target node A through
  multiple layers of aggregation. The first layer combines information from direct
  neighbors (B, C, D) while the second layer incorporates information from nodes
  two hops away (E, F), demonstrating how a node's receptive field grows with
  network depth.
