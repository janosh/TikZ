% The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET for short, is the basic building block of all modern electronics.
% It is also the most frequently manufactured device in history, with close to 10^23 MOSFETs produced since 1960.
% This compact transistor has been miniaturized and mass-produced into oblivion. During this process, it revolutionized the world economy and triggered our ascent into the information age.
