  The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET for short, is the most frequently manufactured device in history, with close to 10^23 MOSFETs produced since 1960. As the basic building block of almost all modern electronics, it revolutionized the world economy and triggered our ascent into the information age.
