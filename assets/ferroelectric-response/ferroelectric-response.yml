  Schematic representation of [ferroelectric response](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferroelectricity) for [BaTiO3](https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-2998) depicting the double-well free energy potential and polarization plots. The figure illustrates the movement of the Titanium atom within the crystal lattice as it shifts between two stable positions, corresponding to minima in the free energy curve. This Titanium displacement results in a large change in the material's polarization.
