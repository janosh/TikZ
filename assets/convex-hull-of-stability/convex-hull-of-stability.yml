  The convex hull of stability represents the lowest energy surface in composition space for a given chemical system. It is constructed by connecting the energies of the most thermodynamically stable compounds at each composition. For visual clarity, only ground-state phases at each composition are shown. Legend:

  - Blue circles: Stable phases lying on the convex hull (blue line)
  - Red squares: Unstable phases above the hull
  - Orange dashed line: Chemical potential range where AX is stable
  - Î”E_d: Decomposition enthalpy, the energy above the hull for unstable phases

  Materials on the hull are stable against decomposition into other phases. The energy difference between a material and the hull (hull distance) quantifies its thermodynamic stability - larger distances meaning less stable and harder to synthesize, making the convex hull a powerful tool for guiding experimental synthesis efforts.
