description: A plot illustrating the temperature-dependent phase transitions of a material as a function of the critical temperature ($T_c$). The blue curve represents the low-temperature phase, the red curve represents the high-temperature phase, and the orange curve shows the critical mass ($m_c$) as a function of temperature. This visualization helps to understand the behavior of materials as they undergo phase transitions due to changes in temperature.
