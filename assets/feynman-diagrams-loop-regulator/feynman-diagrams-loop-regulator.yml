title: Feynman Diagrams Loop Regulator
description: |
  Two Feynman diagrams showing loop corrections to a propagator. Each diagram contains
  a loop with momentum q₀ and two external lines with coupling g. The loops include
  mass terms m₁², m₂² and width terms γ₁², γ₂². The diagrams differ in the position
  of the regulator insertion (cross marker) which appears at the bottom vertex in the
  first diagram and at the top in the second.
