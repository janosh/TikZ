description: >-
  Special contour Cᵦ used to isolate branch cut contributions in Matsubara frequency sums. The contour runs along both sides of the real axis where the sign function s(p₀) changes discontinuously, giving rise to branch cuts in the propagator. This allows separating pole and branch cut contributions.
