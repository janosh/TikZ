title: RG Flow in Theory Space
description: |
  Visualization of renormalization group (RG) flow trajectories in the theory space
  of all possible coupling constants (λ₁, λ₂, λ₃, λ₄) allowed by symmetries. The
  diagram shows how different microscopic actions (S₁, S₂, S₃) obey the same symmetries and thus flow to the same
  quantum effective action (Γ) through different paths, each corresponding to a
  different choice of infrared regulator R_k(q). This illustrates the universality
  of the effective action despite different starting points and regulators.
