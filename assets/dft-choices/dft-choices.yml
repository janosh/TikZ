  Visualization of the many choices involved in a Kohn-Sham calculation. It can
  be non-relativistic based on the classical Schr√∂dinger equation or fully
  relativistic based on the Dirac equation which includes spin-orbit coupling.
  The near-core electrons can be modeled explicitly in an all-electron
  calculation or, much more commonly, incorporated along with the nucleus into
  an effective pseudo-potential. The Hartree energy can be obtained by
  integrating the charge density or by solving the Poisson equation. The
  exchange-correlation potential can be treated with a huge library of density
  functionals, most commonly LDA and GGA. The wave functions can be computed on
  a numerical mesh and expanded in one of many possible basis sets, e.g. plane
  waves, APW, or PAW. Inspired by https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211443.
