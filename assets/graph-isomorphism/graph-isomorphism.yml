  Graphs can look differently but be identical. The only thing that matters are which nodes are connected to which other nodes. If there exists an edge-preserving bijection between two graphs, in other words if there exists a function that maps nodes from one graph onto those of another such that the set of connections for each node remain identical, the two graph are said to be isomorphic.
