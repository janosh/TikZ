description: A plot comparing the distribution functions of Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, and Fermi-Dirac statistics as a function of the reduced chemical potential $\beta (\epsilon - \mu)$. This visualization highlights the differences between the three types of distribution functions, which are used to describe the behavior of particles in different statistical systems.
