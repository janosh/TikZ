description: >-
  Feynman diagrams showing graviton interactions in quantum gravity, illustrating why gravity is difficult to quantize. Unlike other fundamental forces, graviton self-interactions lead to infinitely many terms of increasing complexity, resulting in the non-renormalizability of gravity and motivating the need for theories like string theory.
