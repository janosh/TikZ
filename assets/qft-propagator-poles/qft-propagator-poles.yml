description: >-
  Complex plane visualization of propagator poles and branch cuts in quantum field theory. The diagram shows the analytic structure of Green's functions, including the relationship between retarded/advanced propagators and the placement of poles relative to the real axis. This structure helps understand causality and the connection to Matsubara frequencies.
