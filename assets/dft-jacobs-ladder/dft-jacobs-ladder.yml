title: DFT Jacob's Ladder
description: |
  A visualization of Perdew's Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT),
  representing a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated approximations to the
  exchange-correlation energy (E_xc). The ladder spans from simple local density
  approximations at the bottom to accurate but expensive double-hybrid functionals
  near the top, with each rung adding new physical ingredients to improve accuracy
  at the cost of computational complexity.
