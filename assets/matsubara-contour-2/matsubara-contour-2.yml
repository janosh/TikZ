description: Deformation of contour $C$ in [Matsubara contour 1](https://janosh.github.io/tikz/matsubara-contour-1) into a circle followed by taking the radius to infinity. This will enclose the poles of $(-p_0^2 + x^2)^{-1}$ scattered throughout the complex plane. Their contribution is removed again by enclosing them in clockwise contours.
